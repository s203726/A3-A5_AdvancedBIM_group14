# A5 Project Reflection

## Learning experience

We were completely new to handling IFC files before this course. Taking this course has made the concept and practical use of IFC clearer to us. We've also learned a lot about how to effectively share the knowledge gained. Specifically, we feel we've progressed from a beginner level to a more self-learning stage in OpenBIM and IFCopenshell. However, we still need to improve our coding skills in Python, especially regarding the IFCopenshell library. Despite having many good ideas to enhance our workflow, we felt restricted by our abilities.

## Process

Starting with the first assignment, creating a dashboard in Excel was a logical step that helped us understand how IFC and its information are structured. We donâ€™t think there were too many or too few tools provided, but we lacked detailed guidance on using these tools initially. We appreciated the flexibility of the use case but faced challenges with the recommended IFC models. Having predefined materials in these models would have been beneficial, especially for tasks related to LCA.

## Feedback

According to our peers, they found our use case well-defined, and they understood our goal and scope easily. However, they suggested incorporating visualizations in Blender instead of just showing the creation of a new IFC file. They also suggested improvements for the code, especially regarding the limitations with predefined wall thickness and ensuring user inputs align with the actual wall dimensions.

## Future

While we may not yet feel confident enough to make it a primary focus in our Master's thesis due to our current limitations, we acknowledge the potential of applying OpenBIM and IFC knowledge in Python to extract and modify information. We see it as a tool with various potential applications across different contexts.

## Wrap up

Initially, we felt quite frustrated and struggled due to our lack of coding experience. However, looking back, we believe we've had a steep learning curve and are satisfied with the final tool we've developed.
